# GEO-Match Design Module.

We are using the power of the PlanUML to create the diagrams. Please read the "Getting started" page for more details (http://plantuml.com/starting) or use the on-line editor (https://www.planttext.com/).

The GEO-Match design is based on Robert Martin article, "The Clean Architecture". For more details see (https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
